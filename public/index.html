      Possibility Now
    </h1>
		<h2>A different future is possible</h2>
    <p>
      In this moment of crisis, despite all the challenges, COVID-19 marks a turning point, an opportunity for a profound change of direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default future is bailouts and a few small adjustments to the status quo. We need and want more. We need to ignite and sustain our sense of possibility, our hope for a different future.
    </p>
    <p>
      What has trapped us for too long is our resignation born of isolation. These are collective challenges. We intuitively know that a bigger future is something forged with others, not built alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now, we do not need to know that future, let alone agree on it. This is a moment for us to rebuild the muscle of our imagination, to re-learn how to keep possibility alive, to sustain our capacity for hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us start here and now. By standing up and saying:
    </p>

    <blockquote class="ml-12">
      Yes, I stand for possibility. I stand for a different future, for keeping open the door that has cracked open in this crisis, for keeping alive this conversation not only now but for as long as it takes for us to learn to dream again.
    </blockquote>
