Every intentional change in ourselves and in the world rests on our ability to re-imagine a different future. These futures come alive through the stories we tell and through the images that we share. Futures that spark a sense of possibility, feelings of hope and pave the way for individual and collective action.

Futures Now creates, collects, curates and shares stories of better futures to come. We invite you to share your vision and be part of imagining a future that is bigger and better for all life on this planet.

You can contribute your as artwork, story, poem or concept. Maybe it is something that you have been working on for a long time. Maybe it is something that just comes to you. This is the space to share it.
