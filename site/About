This is about a future that wants to become

*Who is behind?*
We are a group of people that came together during Covid 19 lockdown to reflect on what are the lessons to learn from this crisis. 
What came out of it was that maintaining a sense of possibility would be crucial so we could engage in a long term conversation about what future is worth living for and take concrete steps. 
To commit to the unknown and leave space for possibility to arise. 

*The For who is it?*
This is for anyone who wants to see a different future arise, because we believe that for a different future to take up, forming alliances is paramount. 
For possibility to become a reality coming together as a community standing for change is crucial. 

*What?*
A  place that encourages experiments, conversations  and practical steps for the future to become. 

*What could be possible?* 
Covid19 has taught us that the future is unknown and uncertain, that means that anything is possible. 
What gives our actions in the present is the future we live into, thus envisioning a powerful future worth living is a key dimension to make it happen. 
In a few weeks we could make drastic changes in our life style and shut all the boarders. 
This show that if there is a political will, there is a way! We are here to create a space to regenerate our political will and let the voice of the future rise. 

*What ignited it?*
A deep longing for change. Our humanness.
